Guessing game for 201


Creator: Ellyn Howard Assignment: Guessing Game

This assignment consists of several pages both HTML and JavaScript. The HTML pages tell a little about me as well as a brief description of what is happening with the intrusive pop up questions that appear. This assignment utilized if..else statements, while loops, and arrays! oh my!

Q: How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb? A: None. Thats a hardware problem.



I have updated all pages, html, js, and added css.

Html: Added h2, h3 tags to reflect questions being asked, also added id's to link to js.

js: I put all questions into functions, additionally changed the alerts to one.textContent to make them appear on the browser page rather than in pop ups. Lastly, added className with right and wrong id so able to refer into CSS to change color based on answer.

CSS: created css page elected all right (in js) to be green and all wrong (in js) to be red
